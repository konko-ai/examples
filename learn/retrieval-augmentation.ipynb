    "\n",
    "1. **Business Context Blindness:** An LLM, out of the box, lacks the nuances of your specific business. It's like a fresh recruit on their first day; they don't inherently know the intricacies of your operations or the preferences of your users.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Dynamic Knowledge:** RAG ensures that the information LLMs work with is both vast (from its internal knowledge) and fresh (from external sources).\n",
    "2. **Efficient Fine-Tuning:** RAG allows updates to its knowledge without the need for exhaustive retraining. This flexibility makes it adept at adapting to changing information landscapes.\n",
    "3. **Contextual Business Relevance:** With the right sources, RAG can be tailored to provide business-specific context, making LLM outputs more pertinent to specific user needs and business scenarios."
