Training and Onboarding

Our onboarding program for the Design Department has been formulated with extensive research and insights from current and past employees. The first week is dedicated to understanding the companyâ€™s history, mission, vision, and core values. We ensure this through a series of engaging videos, quizzes, and group discussions. 

The second week shifts focus to department-specific tools, software, and practices. New hires are introduced to our primary design tools like Adobe Suite, Sketch, and Figma. They are paired with a mentor who guides them through real projects to ensure hands-on learning. Workshops are held on the nuances of UI/UX principles, typography, color theory, and our proprietary design methodologies.

Week three is all about collaboration. New hires meet with representatives from other departments, like Marketing and Development, to understand the workflow, feedback loop, and the importance of cross-functional teams. They also work on a mini-project, simulating a complete design cycle, from ideation to final product.

By the fourth week, the training becomes more specific, targeting the individual roles within the department, whether it be graphic design, product design, or motion graphics. This week also includes soft skills training, emphasizing communication, presentation, and critique-reception skills. 

Throughout the month, feedback sessions are held every Friday. The latest feedback showed that new hires highly appreciate the mentorship program, stating it eased their transition. They loved the hands-on approach, with 80% of them feeling confident to start real projects by the end of the third week. However, some expressed the desire for more advanced workshops on emerging design tools. About 10% wished for a deeper dive into motion graphics as they saw it as a growing trend. There was also a suggestion to have a few sessions dedicated solely to understanding user research and integrating findings into the design.
